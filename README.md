# Hi_Intensity_LED
Demonstrates the use of an IRF740 N-Channel MOSFET to switch a 3W High Intensity LED with a microcontroller.  It has been tested with a Texas Instruments MSP430F5529 using Energia and an Arduino Uno.  Note that the LaunchPad does not work well with the IRF740 as explained in the code.  I've posted another circuit using the 2N2222 that works better.
